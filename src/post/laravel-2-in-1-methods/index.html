  <h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Laravel 2 in 1 methods are a great way to speed up your workflow and make more efficient use of your time. By combining two methods of accomplishing the same task, you can get the job done more quickly and with less effort. Here is an example of how you can use this technique in Laravel:</p>
<h2>updateOrCreate()</h2>
<p>The <code>updateOrCreate()</code> method in Laravel is a great way to ensure that you don&rsquo;t have to write multiple queries for data that might already exist in your database. </p>
<p>This method will search for a record based on the given criteria, and if it exists, it will update the record with the new values. If the record does not exist, it will create a new record with the given values. </p>
<p>This method is very useful when dealing with large amounts of data, as it can drastically reduce the amount of code you need to write.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="x">User::updateOrCreate(</span>

<span class="x">    [&#39;name&#39; =&gt; &#39;John Doe&#39;],</span>

<span class="x">    [&#39;email&#39; =&gt; &#39;john@example.com&#39;]</span>

<span class="x">);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The above code is an example of how to use the updateOrCreate() method in Laravel. This method will search for a record based on the given criteria, and if it exists, it will update the record with the new values. If the record does not exist, it will create a new record with the given values.  This is a great way to make sure you don&rsquo;t have to write multiple queries for data that might already exist in your database.</p>
<h2>firstOrCreate()</h2>
<p>The firstOrCreate() method in Laravel is a great alternative to the updateOrCreate() method. This method will search for a record based on the given criteria, and if it exists, it will return the existing record. If the record does not exist, it will create a new record with the given values. This method can be useful when dealing with smaller amounts of data, as it eliminates the need to write multiple queries.</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="x">User::firstOrCreate([</span>

<span class="x">    &#39;name&#39; =&gt; &#39;John Doe&#39;,</span>

<span class="x">    &#39;email&#39; =&gt; &#39;john@example.com&#39;</span>

<span class="x">]);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The above code is an example of how to use the <code>firstOrCreate()</code> method in Laravel. This method will search for a record based on the given criteria, and if it exists, it will return the existing record. If the record does not exist, it will create a new record with the given values. This method can be useful when dealing with smaller amounts of data, as it eliminates the need to write multiple queries.</p>
<h2>upsert()</h2>
<p>The <code>upsert()</code> method in Laravel Eloquent is a great way to ensure that you don&rsquo;t have to write multiple queries for data that might already exist in your database. This method will search for a record based on the given criteria, and if it exists, it will update the record with the new values. If the record does not exist, it will create a new record with the given values.</p>
<p>For example, if you wanted to update a user&rsquo;s name and email address in the database, you could use the <code>upsert()</code> method like this:</p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="x">User::upsert([</span>

<span class="x">    &#39;name&#39; =&gt; &#39;John Doe&#39;,</span>

<span class="x">    &#39;email&#39; =&gt; &#39;john@example.com&#39;</span>

<span class="x">]);</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>This will update the user&rsquo;s name and email address if they already exist in the database, or create a new record if they do not.</p>
